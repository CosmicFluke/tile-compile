Constraint Satisfaction Routines
   A) class Variable

      This class allows one to define CSP variables.

      On initialization the variable object can be given a name, and
      an original domain of values. This list of domain values can be
      added but NOT deleted from.
      
      To support constraint propagation, the class also maintains a
      set of flags to indicate if a value is still in its current domain.
      So one can remove values, add them back, and query if they are 
      still current. 

    B) class constraint

      This class allows one to define constraints specified by tables
      of satisfying assignments.

      On initialization the variables the constraint is over is
      specified (i.e. the scope of the constraint). This must be an
      ORDERED list of variables. This list of variables cannot be
      changed once the constraint object is created.

      Once initialized the constraint can be incrementally initialized
      with a list of satisfying tuples. Each tuple specifies a value
      for each variable in the constraint (in the same ORDER as the
      variables of the constraint were specified).

    C) Backtracking routine---takes propagator and CSP as arguments
       so that basic backtracking, forward-checking or GAC can be 
       executed depending on the propagator used.

class Variable:
    """
    Class for defining CSP variables.  On initialization the
    variable object should be given a name, and optionally a list of
    domain values. Later on more domain values an be added...but
    domain values can never be removed.

    The variable object offers two types of functionality to support
    search.

    (a) It has a current domain, implemented as a set of flags
       determining which domain values are "current", i.e., un-pruned.
       - you can prune a value, and restore it.
       - you can obtain a list of values in the current domain, or count
         how many are still there

    (b) You can assign and un-assign a value to the variable.
       The assigned value must be from the variable domain, and
       you cannot assign to an already assigned variable.

       You can get the assigned value e.g., to find the solution after
       search.

       Assignments and current domain interact at the external interface
       level. Assignments do not affect the internal state of the current domain
       so as not to interact with value pruning and restoring during search.

       But conceptually when a variable is assigned it only has
       the assigned value in its current domain (viewing it this
       way makes implementing the propagators easier). Hence, when
       the variable is assigned, the 'cur_domain' returns the
       assigned value as the sole member of the current domain,
       and 'in_cur_domain' returns True only for the assigned
       value. However, the internal state of the current domain
       flags are not changed so that pruning and un-pruning can
       work independently of assignment and un-assignment.
